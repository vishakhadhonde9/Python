# Programming -
- A programming is acts as a mediator between machine and human.
- The programming language is main purpose is to convert high-level instruction to low-level instruction and low-level instruction to high-level

# Program -
- A Program can be defined as a set of instructions given to a computer to achieve any objective.
- Instructions can be given to a computer by writing programs.
- Tasks can be automated by giving instructions to the computers.

# Python -
- Python is a high-level language like other high-level language such as Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic and Perl.
- Python is an object-oriented programming language.
- The CPU understands a language which is called as Machine Language. Machine language is very complex and very troublesome to write because it is represented all in zero's and one's. The actual hardware inside CPU does not understand any of these high-level languages.
# Scripting -
- Scripting language is a programming language used to automate tasks, control software, or connect different systems together.
- 
# Features of Python -
- Open Source
- Its has only interpreter
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Secure
- Portable
- Cross- platform

# Interpreter vs Compiler -
- The complier is execute entire code at a time and it takes faster time to execute the code.
- The interpreter is execute the code line by line and it takes less time to execute the code.
- The interpreter is faster then complier because it checks the code  line by line and it is fast to find error and it stores the data in primary memory.
