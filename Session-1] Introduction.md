# Programming -
- A programming is acts as a mediator between machine and human.
- The programming language is main purpose is to convert high-level instruction to low-level instruction and low-level instruction to high-level

# Program -
- A Program can be defined as a set of instructions given to a computer to achieve any objective.
- Instructions can be given to a computer by writing programs.
- Tasks can be automated by giving instructions to the computers.

# Python -
- Python is a high-level language like other high-level language such as Java, C++, PHP, Ruby, Basic and Perl.
- Python is an object-oriented programming language.
- The CPU understands a language which is called as Machine Language. Machine language is very complex and very troublesome to write because it is represented all in zero's and one's. The actual hardware inside CPU does not understand any of these high-level languages.

# Scripting -
- Scripting language is a programming language used to automate tasks, control software, or connect different systems together.
- Scripts are ideal for automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks.

# Features of Python -
## Easy to Learn and Read: 
- Python's syntax is clean and similar to the English language, relying on indentation rather than semicolons or brackets, which makes it an excellent choice for beginners and emphasizes code readability.
## Interpreted Language: 
- Python code is executed line by line at runtime by an interpreter, which simplifies the debugging process and allows for rapid prototyping, as there is no need for a lengthy compilation step.
## Free and Open Source: 
- The Python software is available for free download and use, and its source code is publicly available and and active community that contributes to its continuous improvement.
## Large Standard Library and Ecosystem: 
- Python comes with a comprehensive standard library offering modules for a wide range of tasks. This is supplemented by a massive ecosystem of third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow) available.
## Dynamically Typed: 
- Developers do not need to explicitly declare variable types; the Python interpreter determines them at runtime based on the assigned value.
## Cross-Platform/Portable: 
- Python programs can run on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, without requiring significant modifications.
## Automatic Memory Management: 
- Python handles dynamic memory allocation and deallocation automatically through a process called garbage collection, freeing developers from manual memory management.

# Interpreter vs Compiler -
- The complier is execute entire code at a time and it takes faster time to execute the code.
- The interpreter is execute the code line by line and it takes less time to execute the code.
- The interpreter is faster then complier because it checks the code  line by line and it is fast to find error and it stores the data in primary memory.
