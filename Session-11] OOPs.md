# Encapsulation -
- Encapsulation in Python is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP).
- It refers to the practice of restricting access to certain details of an object and exposing only necessary information.
- This is typically done by hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to be performed through public methods.
