# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)-
- OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming System, a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects."
- These objects represent real-world entities with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods).
- OOPs organizes software design by bundling data and functions together into these objects, promoting modularity, reusability, and abstraction.
